        <h1>Hi, I'm Rebecca!</h1>
        <div class="introduction">
            <p>Hi there! I'm a junior studying User Experience (UX) Design at the University of Michigan in School of Information. 
                I'm also pursuing a minor in Asian Studies (concentrating on Japan). 
                I'm passionate about creating inclusive and accessible design that makes a positive impact on our community. 
                On campus I work as an Information Services intern at the University of Michigan Opportunity Hub. 
                I'm also a Creative Designer in the Michigan Advertising and Marketing club where I'm currently working with Argus Farm Stop to improve their online ordering website.
                Off campus I enjoy going out to eat and drink with friends, hosting dinner parties, and watching and reviewing documentaries. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Ever since I was a little kid I was a foodie. I enjoyed cozying up on the couch with my sisters to watch Barefoot Contessa and Cake Boss. Whenever I could, I would help out my mom in the kitchen.
                Eventhough it was just rolling dough into balls or breaking the ends off green beans, I loved it.
                That love of food naturally expanded to include drinks as well. Now, as much as I still enjoy cooking, I really love baking as there is a level of precision that goes with baking that makes it even
                more satisfying when it comes out looking and tasting good. One of my bucket list goals is to one day open up a little cozy cafe! Until then I'll just continue baking in my little college apartment kitchen. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>As you navigate through this website, you'll get to learn about my favorite desserts and drinks and why. I hope you enjoy your stay here and that you don't get too hungry!</p>
