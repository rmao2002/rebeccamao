            <p>
                Though I've been conditioned ever since a kid to only really drink water because it was the healthiest and cheapest drink option from my parents point of view, below are 
                my favorite drinks when I don't want to drink water. They're broken down into 3 categories: Starbucks go-tos, alcoholic favorites, and asian drinks.

            <h2>My Starbucks Go-Tos</h2>
            <p>I don't go to Starbucks often as I usually like to get my coffee from smaller local cafes (also Starbucks has raised their prices while the quality of their drinks stayed the same).
            Yet sometimes when I just want a quick drink to pick up and go, I'll go to my closest Starbucks and get one of my usual three drinks. 
            Depending on the weather, I'll rotate between getting a Pink Drink, a Caramel Mocha, and an Iced Matcha Latte. 
            </p>

            <h2>Alcoholic Favorites</h2>
            <p>
                I'm not the biggest fan of the taste of alcohol so when I wish to drink alcohol (responsibly of course), I'll opt for a fruity cocktail or something sparkling. My favorites being champagne, mojitos, and dirty shirleys.

        <div class="text-container">
            <h2>Asian Drinks</h2>
            <p>
                Now asian drinks are drinks that I could drink daily. They're usually fruity and not overbearingly sweet. If I want something that will be filling and customizable I'll drink a bubble (boba) tea.
                If I want something healthy, I'll drink Yakult which is a yogurt drink because it contains probiotics which helps with gut health.
                Lastly, if I want something really refreshing I'll go with a lychee lemonade.
