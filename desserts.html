            <p>Although I don't have a crazy sweet tooth, somethings about the beautiful designs of desserts draw me in. 
                As you scroll down you'll see my favorite deserts broken down into 3 categories: summer time desserts, fall time desserts
                and desserts that have childhool memories attached to them. </p>

            <h2>Summer Time Desserts</h2>
            <p>
                Lemon pound cake, mochi ice cream, and tiramisu are all desserts I enjoy indulging in during the hot summer months.
                They're all light in texture or fruit flavored which gives a refreshing taste, perfect for the summer!

            <h2>Fall Time Desserts</h2>
            <P>
                Once the weather gets colder, I love baking and eating more heavier desserts utilizing seasonal ingredients.
                My favorite desserts to cuddle up with during the colder months are apple crumble, banana bread, and baked egg tarts.

            <h2>Desserts That Envoke Nostalgia</h2>
            <p>
                The desserts shown below are all desserts that envoke childhood nostalgia. As a child, one of the few things my mom knew how to bake was a strawberry cream roll cake.
                I remember getting so excited when I saw her rolling up the cake with fresh whipped cream. Another dessert that I rarely get to indulge in today are Chinese bakery style cakes.
                These cakes differ from others as they are made of light yellow sponge cake with a variety of seasonal fruit in between the layers covered in a thick layer of whipped cream. 
                These were the cakes my family would get to celebrate birthdays. Lastly, my childhood isn't complete without chocolate chip cookies. These were the first thing I ever baked
                myself. It's also a classic, who doesn't like chocolate chip cookies?
